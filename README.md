# BlackAdder
Additive synthesizer audio unit

This supercedes my [Plus](https://github.com/wbajzek/Plus) project. 
I am starting over from the ground up with more experience and a better plan.
Plus was sort of haphazardly thrown together and committed to git in an 
undisciplined fashion; I intend to iterate on BlackAdder more thoughtfully
with the goal of producing a stable, performant, professional-quality product
which will remain free and open source. 

I have a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/HUgnYxis/additive-synthesizer) for
this project.
